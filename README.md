I've been living, learning and experiencing this world from breathing to crawling, from trades to acting, and from cooking to staffing since 1986. My decisions and actions have brought me to this point in time where programming, coding, and problem solving have become an addiction and obession of mine. All this has led me to embark on a journey into becoming a `Digital Blacksmith`.

<h2>‚ú® October 2022</h2>

Still working 10 - 12hr shifts from 4 - 6 days a week as a heavy lifting warehouse associate. The difference being that I've now graduated from The Software Guild with the Java Full Stack Bootcamp. Looking now to refine my skills while defining my path and preparing to change careers into a ...

<h2>‚ú® August 2021</h2>
<p>
Still working 10 - 12hr shifts from 4 - 6 days a week. The only difference now is that I'm a heavy lifting warehouse associate <b>AND</b> I've embarked on my journey into becoming a full stack developer. 

<h3 align="center"><i>"This bootcamp was broken down into two (2) semesters with ten (10) milestones and an Intro to Web Development pre-requisite course. It is a one-year intensive bootcamp that covered ... "</i></h3>

Everything and anything from:
<ul>
    <li>Fundamentals - Git, GitHub, World Wide Web and the Internet
    <li>Front-End Development - HTML, CSS with Bootstrap, JavaScript
    <li>Object Oriented Programming - Java, MVC and Tiered Application Design Concenpts for CRUD Applications
    <li>Unit Testing - Stateless, Stateful with JUnit
    <li>Frameworks - Maven, Spring with Dependency Injections
    <li>Back-End Development - Relational Databases, MySQL, JdbcTemplate, JPA, Spring Boot with Thymeleaf, Spring MVC
    <li>REST Web Services via jQuery
    <li>Final Project - Spring Boot Full Stack Web App, <i>superherosightings</i>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>‚ú® September 2019</h2>
<p>
Started working 10 - 12hr shifts from 4 - 6 days a week as a warehouse associate. The duties were physically taxing, the work-days were long, and the work-weeks were never ending. My mind, body and soul were aching for a change. So I opted out to join their learning department and train new associates to do what I did.

<h3 align="center"><i>"Figured I'd put my teaching skillset to use. But my soul was asking for more."</i></h3>

Fortunately, my employer provided resources that allowed us to explore careers outside the warehouse setting. And with that I was introduced to the <b><i>Java Full Stack Bootcamp</i></b> provided by a company called <b><i>The Software Guild</i></b> through my employer.
